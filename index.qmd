## Recommended R Training Resources

-   [R for Data Science, Second Edition by Hadley Wickham](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/ "R for Data Science, Second Edition by Hadley Wickham")

-   [R Cookbook by Paul Teetor](https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/r-cookbook/9780596809287/ "R Cookbook by Paul Teetor")

The *R Cookbook* is a good reference and is easier to search than the Hadley Wickham book.
